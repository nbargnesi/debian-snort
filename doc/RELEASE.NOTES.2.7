2007-07-09 - Snort 2.7.0

[*] New Additions
    * Stream5 is now the default stream processor and replaces both flow
      and Stream4.  Refer to the Snort manual and README.stream5 for
      details on how to configure it for OS target-specific TCP
      processing.

[*] Improvements
    * Fixed header files to avoid conflicts with system files on BSD for
      IPv6 data structures.

    * Reduced memory footprint for smtp preprocessor.

    * Ensured Snort frees memory from preprocessors before exit.  Only
      outstanding memory in use is related to pattern matcher and
      rules.

[*] Security Improvements
    * Further updates that use safer functions that perform bounds checking
      when doing string or memory copies and snprintf buffer writes.
      Ensure null termination on string buffers and perform initialization
      on memory allocations.
