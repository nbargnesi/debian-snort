snort (2.3.3-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Recompile to use latest libmysqlclient libraries (Closes: #366748)
  * Remove the following unused dependencies as suggested by  Stefan Huehner:
    libsnmp4.2-dev and libssl-dev (and their --with calls in debian/rules) . I'm
    still keeping the coreutils | fileutils dependency since I still want to
    compile this package in woody.(Closes: #365874)
  * Also remove DH_COMPAT from debian/rules as suggested by  Stefan Huehner in
    #365874
  * Move 'debian/my/lisapaper.txt' to snort-doc.docs and remove from snort,
    snort-pgsql and snort-mysql doc files (Closes: #340091)
  * Have faq.tex use hyperref.sty instead of latex2html's html.sty and comment
    the \latexonly definitions. This makes latex2html unnecessary to
    build the package (Closes: #365872)
  * doc-base files now point to the compressed PDF documents (lintian fix)
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - French translation provided by Christian Perrier (Closes: #359285)

snort (2.3.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated Build-Dependencies to use libmysqlclient15-dev instead of the 
    old libmysqlclient10 library (Closes: #356706)
  * Add a 'DEBIAN_SNORT_SEND_STATS' option (controlled by debconf) to allow
    users to define if snort should send daily stats. Users that want to
    change the frequency should manually move over the cron.daily script
    to other cron.XXX locations (Closes: #353035)
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - Dutch translation with patch provided by Peter Vandenabeele
    - Spanish Debconf translation ('send_stats' template)
  * Do not indent '@' in the e-mail of users that receive the stats (Closes: #335803)
  * Preliminary code (only in snort.config) to detect if the default interface
    is up when configuring Snort, the Debconf question priority is raised if
    the interface is not up or it does not exist and the user is pestered
    if he still provides an invalid answer (unless he doesn't see the
    question, which is the case if running with debconf priority set to
    'high', in this case, we bail out)
    Note: will introduce this in the DB packages after it gets some testing
    out there.
  * Change the Debconf priority of the note that warns that  the configuration
    is not working to 'critical' (was 'high')
  * Acknowledge NMU made by Margarita:
    * Drop automake1.6 dependency in Build-Depends (Closes: #335143)
    * Updated config.guess and config.sub with the latest versions available
      to prevent FTBFS on GNU/k*BSD (Closes: #342446)
    * Updated german debconf translation with patch provided by Erik Schanze 
      (Closes: #345855)

snort (2.3.3-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Backport the following changes introduced in 2.4.1. Upstream changelog:
      * src/log.c:
        Fix problem in sniffer mode when incomplete TCP option data is received.
        Thanks A Hernandez for the find.
    (Closes: #328134)
    Note: This is a "security" bug but no CVE is assigned, it is actually
    something that can happen only if a Snort user willingly shoots himself
    on the foot (uses ASCII logging mode) or if he uses the fast output
    mode with some non-default options.
    For a detailed view see:
    Martin Roesch's mail "Snort DoS Fallacies" to snort-users and bugtraq:

    To summarise: The only recommended alert methods in a production sensor
    are unified, syslog or database. And unified is The Right Way to run
    a sensor (others have important performance issues under high load )
    NOTE to Debian Security teams: I don't believe this bug merits a DSA 
    (or a DTSA for that matter)
    (Closes: #328134)
  * Backport the following changes introduced in 2.4.2. Upstream changelog:
      * src/output-plugins/spo_log_database.c:

snort (2.3.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Dependency on "debconf | debconf-2.0" as requested by Joey Hess
  * Use Debhelper compatibility version 4
  * New mechanism for database packages:
    - Introduce a mechanism to create /etc/snort/db-pending-config on
      initial installation of the database packages.
    - Have the init.d script abort the start attempt if the 
      /etc/snort/db-pending-config file exists.
    - Describe how to setup the database support in README-database.Debian
      and install this document in the database packages.
      (Closes: #205683, #219696, #265735, #265878, #290104, #291616)
  * po-debconf changes:
    (still waiting a little bit before switching to dbconfig-common)
    - Sinchronise all the debconf templates of the different snort 
      variants.
    - Change the wait_for_db_config message, now called 'needs_db_config'
      and provides slightly different information.
    - Fixed typos in German debconf translation courtesy of Jens Seidel

    - Fix the templates so that all the files use the same strings, that
      should reduce the workload of translating almost identical lines.
      (but also fuzzies more of the translations above)

snort (2.3.2-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Medium priority since it seems some buildds are not auto building
    snort ok and this changes fix it.
  * Use PostgreSQL 8.0 now as requested by Martin Pitt. Basicly just
    changed the build-depends and use 'pg_config --includedir' when
    setting the location of the PostgreSQL location. 
  * Changes to configure.in: (Closes: #313499)
    * Fixed configure.in so that it uses the --with dir directly first
      (intead of looking for $i/include and stuff like that). 
    * Fixed configure.in so that it outputs the PostgreSQL directories 
      it tested by fixing a typo.
    * Have all ERROR messages abort with an exit 1 so that the Makefile breaks
      and we will notice the error if doing an automatic build.

snort (2.3.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Snort, snort-pgsql and snort-mysql now depend on either coreutils
    or earlier packages which provided 'stat'. This should prevent
    partial-upgrades of woody systems which prevent snort's init scripts
    from running (Closes: #311616)

  * Changed debian/TODO
  * Snort-common now Replaces old snort versions (1.8.4beta1-1) since
    the configuration files where moved there from snort. 
    Save for the ppp configuration file which was moved from snort-common to
    snort. Snort now Replaces snort-common versions previous to 2.0.2-3, 
    that introduced the change, cannot conflict since we will end up with
    circular dependencies. (Closes: #311257)
  * Check MD5sums before rule files are moved from the old location to the
    new one in snort-rules-default's preinst when upgrading.
    If the files have not been changed from the ones provided
    by the woody version then remove them (Closes: #311263)

snort (2.3.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  (First attempt at experimental, to avoid breaking installations running sid)
  * New upstream release 
  * This version now uses libnet1, changed Build-Depends (Closes: #241995)
  * Introduced /etc/default/snort and removed /etc/snort/common.parameters
    this makes it easier to check for common situations (parsing the parameter
    file is quite complicated). The old common.parameters file is moved
    over to /etc/default/snort automatically, but retained in case
    the parsing has not been done properly (and will not be used until
    the common.parameters file is removed). This is described in the
    NEWS.Debian file.
  * Fixed the postint call so that the passwd and group are checked before
    they are created. Also fix chown call (still used '.' instead of ':')
  * Introduce a check for the status of Snort's logdirectory, it checks if
    it belongs to Snort (Closes: #247603)
  * This release provides debconf support for snort sensors in 
    multiple interfaces (Closes: #283816)
  * Run update-debconf, seems I had not done this when I last made changes
    in the templates in 2.2.0-8
  * Included the documentation available, including signatures. Also
    added the LaTeX manual included as well as the additional Build-Depends
    on tetex-bin and gs-common
  * Updated the FAQ (was about time!) from http://www.snort.org/docs/FAQ.txt
  * Added a README.docs file (pointing people to more documents)

snort (2.2.0-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make snort-common Arch: all (Closes: #278987) 
  * The installation will now check if you are using a configuration that
    will not be able to work with the current Snort version and will forewarn
    you. The package installation will still fail (if Snort is started
    automatically) but the administrator will be pointed to where the
    error is (Closes: #165107)
  * Use dh_installman instead of dh_installmanpages and provide proper
    PACKAGE.manpages file since dh_installmanpages now fails to create the
    snort-common package properly.
  * Updated to the latest rules snapshot
  * Added an 'update-rules' target in debian/rules that downloads the 
    latest rules snapshot and installs it in the package.

snort (2.2.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a 'config-check' option in init.d to test the user's configuration
    file. This could be used to determine (in postinst) if snort should be
    restarted and warn the user (not yet done). This will help fix #165107,
    #165351 (since similar user mistakes would be detected), #276565 and
    #247665.
  * Added more information to the TODOs
  * Moved DEBIAN_TRESHOLD to DEBIAN_THRESHOLD (save for the debconf value
    in order to avoid reseting it) (Closes: #256581)
  * Removed double space in template (Closes: #275936)
  * The snort-rules package now Suggests: snort instead of depending on it

snort (2.2.0-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added config-file discovery to ppp init.scripts so that Snort is
    started (-c) with the proper configuration file if available or 
    snort.conf if not. Setting high severity so that users running
    Snort with PPP don't end up with a full /var filesystem (Closes: #268707)
  * Fixed bashism in /etc/ppp/if-up.d/snort
  * Modified the init.d an if-up.d scripts so that
    /etc/snort/snort.common.parameters is only used if it exists.
  * Snort-rules-default now Recommends: oinkmaster 
    now that it is in the archive (accepted 01 Oct 2004), this does not
    close #191105 since IMHO a better signature update mechanism should 
    be introduced. Also updated the related TODO item.
  * Added a FAQ Q&A regarding rule updates in README.Debian
  * Added code to detect for deprecated preprocessors and warn the user,
    curretnly the code will not touch the configuration files himself and
    will not detect if you are using the standard package configuration file.
    It will prevent users from having configuration issues, however
    (Closes: #247665)
  * Modified the init.d file so you can use 'status' to determine if
    the Snort sensors are up or not.
  * Updated the 2.2 rule set with the snapshot provided at snort.org, new rules
    include detection of the recent JPEG exploit (Closes: #274244)

  ! Once again: Thanks Mario 'BitKoenig' Holbe for your great help:
    + Moved 'dialup' interface guessing from ppp/ip-up to postinst
  + Cleanup restart: only restart current running interfaces
    This also cleans up: 'dialup' logcheck failure, if no snort running
  + Prepare for multisensor support
  + Use start-stop-daemon --retry instead of sleep and kill -9
  + Use invoke-rc.d only, if it exists
    Closes: #191574
  + Correct please_restart to please_restart_manually
  + Re-Unified prerm and postinst scripts
  + Fix the backward-compatible just-kill-them-all in prerm;
    do we really need it? It definitely didn't work before and
    since the old-package prerm is called anyways, we shouldn't.
  + Simplify snort.debian.conf creation

  + snort-doc/examples now has a snort-rules auto-update script!
    Closes: #242521, thanks Marcel!
  + Updated fr.po by Christian Perrier

snort (2.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  + New upstream release
    Closes: #238427
  + Added catalan debconf templates (debian/po/ca.po)
    Closes: #236644
  + Fixed packaging bugs.
  + Applied following changes by Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña. Thanks!!
      * Snort group is now created using --system in all packages
        Closes: #231580
      * Both the cron.daily script and the postinst scripts set a default
        value for STATS_RCPT and STATS_TRESHOLD to avoid buggy behaviours
        if the user does not setup a proper value when interfacing with
        debconf. Still, these values should be checked in the config 
        scripts. (Closes: #173331)
      * Snort-stat now exists if there are no results which will avoid
        it from sending empty emails 
        (Closes: #217913, #174508, #192401, #172529)
      * Improved the explanations in several templates (Closes: #217173)
      * Updated Japanese translation (and fixed some po format errors,
        hopefully without damaging the po file) (Closes: #226680)
      * Included Catalan debconf translation (Closes: #236644)
      * Updated pt-BR debconf translation (Closes: #228244)
      * Re-Added (partial) spanish debconf translation (it seems that 
        the work I did back in december 2001 has not been moved to po-debconf!)

    * The postinst now creates /etc/snort/snort.debian.conf if it doesn't
      exist by echoing a basic content into the file. Kinda ugly, but it
      works.

      to the DNS_SERVER value in snort.conf. Although I think this was fixed
      in 1.8.4beta2
    + Closes: #116169
    * I added 1 or 2 lines of short descriptive text to each package's
      description. It should be more clear now.

    * These are left-over bugs. Fixed in earlier releases.
    + Closes: #128689, #131049
    * Fixed the init.d script so that it doesn't say "already started" on
      errors. Snort returns 0(good) or 1(bad), not 2.
    + Closes: #143268
    * The supplied patch didn't contain any valid patchable entries. The
      script has changed that much that I assume it has been fixed already.
  * Thanks, smeenk :)
