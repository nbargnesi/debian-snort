daq (0.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial release. 
  * This library is required for Snort 2.9.0 (produced by the Snort team).
    Since I will be targetting experimental with Snort 2.9.0 I'm uploading this
    library there too.
  * debian/patches/10_dnet-to-dumbnet.diff: Patch to use dumbnet instead of
    dnet. It is not applied as it currently breaks the build due to an autoconf
    issue (to be investigated). This only prevents the IPQ and NFQ DAQs from
    being available (but the PCAP module should work)
