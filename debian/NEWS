snort (2.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * In Snort version 2.3.0 and later the preferred configuration method
    uses /etc/default/snort rather than /etc/snort/snort.common.parameters.
    The new approach makes it possible to introduce improvements in the
    init.d script, such as sanity checks for common misconfigurations.

  * Upgrading automatically generates the file /etc/default/snort
    from /etc/snort/snort.common.parameters. 

  * Since the automatically generated file may not be correct, you should 
    inspect it or create a new one to your liking.  If the configuration
    file is correct, delete /etc/snort/snort.common.parameters and restart
    the server to use the new file. The system will run Snort with the old
    configuration file until you do so.
