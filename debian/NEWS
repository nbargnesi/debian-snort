The snort package, Since version 2.3.0, introduces /etc/default/snort
and no longer uses /etc/snort/common.parameters. The new configuration
file will be automatically created based on the old configuration.
However, since there is no way to know if the old file has been parsed
properly, the old parameters file will be used in the /etc/init.d/script
file until it has been removed.

Please check the contents of /etc/default/snort (or create a new one)
and remove /etc/snort/common.parameters to take advantage of the 
improvements introduced in the init.d script.
