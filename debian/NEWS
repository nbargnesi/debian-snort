snort (2.7.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

 Sourcefire changed the license of the IDS ruleset in 2.4 introducing the "VRT
 Certified rules" ruleset which is the official ruleset for Snort. This
 ruleset, however, is provided only through a non-free license which prohibits
 redistribution within this package.

 As a consequence this package provides only free (GPL) rules. No rule 
 with a sid in the 3,465-1,000,000 range (VRT Certified) is included here.
 The rules provided on this package are based on the official ruleset for
 Snort 2.4 (updated 7/27/05) and the Community ruleset.

 Certified rules download require users either to pay (if they want the latest
 rules) or register (for rules provided with a 30-delay period). Users
 whishing to go this way can use the 'oinkmaster' package to auomatically
 update their rulesets once they have registered at snort.org's site.

snort (2.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * In Snort version 2.3.0 and later the preferred configuration method
    uses /etc/default/snort rather than /etc/snort/snort.common.parameters.
    The new approach makes it possible to introduce improvements in the
    init.d script, such as sanity checks for common misconfigurations.

  * Upgrading automatically generates the file /etc/default/snort
    from /etc/snort/snort.common.parameters. 

  * Since the automatically generated file may not be correct, you should 
    inspect it or create a new one to your liking.  If the configuration
    file is correct, delete /etc/snort/snort.common.parameters and restart
    the server to use the new file. The system will run Snort with the old
    configuration file until you do so.
