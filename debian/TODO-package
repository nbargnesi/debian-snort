TODO

- Make it easier to do changes in maintainer's config files. Currently snort, snort-pgsql
  and snort-mysql config files share a lot of code which makes it unmaintainable and leads
  to bugs like #502084 which was fixed in Snort (non-DB package) but not in the DB packages.

- Consider the use of dbconfig-common to make database creation and update a
  breeze. Asking users to follow manual steps to configure the database before
  the package installation is rather painful.

- Sync the versions provided in the archive with the source code @Alioth

- Make it possible for admins to provide more than one interface Snort will
  listen to when configuring the package

- When configuring the package it could try to check if the database defined
  is, indeeded, properly setup so that Snort can use it as a logging database.
