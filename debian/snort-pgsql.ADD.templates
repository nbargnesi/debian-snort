_Description: Snort needs a configured database to log to before it starts
 Snort needs a configured database before it can successfully start up.
 In order to create the structure you need to run the following commands
 AFTER the package is installed:
  cd /usr/share/doc/snort-pgsql/
  zcat create_postgresql.gz | psql -U <user> -h <host> -W <databasename>
 Fill in the correct values for the user, host, and database names.
 PostgreSQL will prompt you for the password.
 .
 After you created the database structure, you will need to start Snort
 manually.
