- The snort-common package currently does not check if you _accepted_ the
  config file provided, this is related to bug #247665 which is partially
  fixed by the snort-common Source-Version depends introduced in 2.2.0-2

- Determine, if the interface is configured and up and has an assigned
  IP address, the address range for the sensor in an automatic way
  (see bug #248000)

- Provide an update script, as required in #191105, snort-rules-default
  currently recommends: 'oinkmaster' but that is sub-optimal

- Offer the user an option to automatically create the database since
  the /usr/share/doc/snort* stuff is not available on installation.
  Review what other packages (gnudip? horde? imp? sitebar? openwebmail?)
  have done and consider the use of the generic user for database
  administration.  Note that database permissions for the 'snort' 
  user need to be properly setup!

- Add some common logcheck rules (see #222584, and #217175)
