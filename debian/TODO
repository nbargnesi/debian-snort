TODO things for Snort in Debian
-------------------------------

- Offer the user an option to automatically create the database since
  the schemas (at /usr/share/doc/snort*) stuff is not available on installation.
  Review what other packages (gnudip? horde? imp? sitebar? openwebmail?)
  have done and consider the use of the generic user for database
  administration.  Note that database permissions for the 'snort' 
  user need to be properly setup!
  Also see: http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg01104.html
  http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg00340.html
  and

  I probably need to take a look at how wwwconfig-common or use the
  new dbconfig-common information does it...

- Include Rpm improvements to the init.d file suchas :

   * The init.d file could use separate LOGDIR files per interface instead of
     one for all instances (bound to break) just like it's done in the RedHat
     init script. The check_logdir function should be called per possible LOGDIR
     definition. If the LOGDIR did not exist it should be created with proper
     permissions.

     Note: logrotate definitions will need to be changed if this is changed

   * stats option in the init.d file
   * Additional /etc/default/snort parameters similar to the RPM ones for
     compatibility

- Use ucf to integrate changes by the maintainer when upgrading

- Break up the init.d script into reusable functions 
  Also: add a check in order to determine if the snort sensor started
  up properly or it did not.

- The check_log_dir check in the init.d script could best check if the
  LOGDIR directory is writable by the snort user. It might not be good
  (security-wise) to force it's owned by the snort user (since then
  it would be able to remove its own logs)

- Check if --enable-flexresp works with libnet 1.1.x

- The snort-common package currently does not check if you _accepted_ the
  config file provided, this is related to bug #247665 which is partially
  fixed by the snort-common Source-Version depends introduced in 2.2.0-2

- Provide support to avoid specifying the address range for multiple
  interfaces (or skip this if you have more than once and substitute
  by a note telling the admin to configure this in the snort.$IFACE.conf 
  file). 

- Rewrite the "address range" question. It actually does not explain what
  it is actually used for (HOME_NET)

- Determine, if the interface is configured and up and has an assigned
  IP address, the address range for the sensor in an automatic way
  This should also handle multiple interfaces.
  (see bug #248000)

- Provide an update script, as required in #191105, snort-rules-default
  currently recommends: 'oinkmaster' but that is sub-optimal

- Add some common logcheck rules (see #222584, and #217175)

DONE

- Have a way in preinst to migragte from the old common.parameters to the
  new /etc/default/snort so that all users can benefit from it.
